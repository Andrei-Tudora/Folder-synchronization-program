## Overview
The provided Python script is a file synchronization program that continuously monitors a source directory and synchronizes any changes (additions, modifications, or deletions) to a replica directory. It uses a simple hash-based file comparison to determine if a file needs synchronization.
The program runs in an infinite loop with a specified time interval, allowing it to react promptly to changes in the source directory. It logs all synchronization activities to a specified log file.
